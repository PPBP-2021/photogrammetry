## What is Photogrammetry?
Photogrammetry is the science of making measurements from photographs.
It is used to reconstruct the third dimension (the depth) of two-dimensional images.
The application of photogrammetry is widespread and includes surveying, measuring, modeling, and 3D reconstruction.

### Related fields
- land surveying
    - google earth
- computer vision
    - autonomous driving
- computer graphics
    - 3D modeling

### Approaches
- Shape from Shading
    - reconstruct the shape of an object using shadow and light information
- Structure from Motion
    - reconstruct the 3D structure of a scene from a set of 2D images
- **Stereo-photogrammetry** (our approach)
    - keypoint triangulation

-----------------
## Motivation
In the past we worked on a video game. One of the main challenges was to create good looking 3D models.
Creating 3D models is a time consuming task.
We already knew of *photogrammetry* as a way to automate model generation, but didn't know how it worked.
Furthermore we are generally interested in *computer vision* and *image processing*.
So we decided to learn more about it and create our own photogrammetry project.


### Goals
- learn about camera basics
    - 3D to 2D projection
- learn about image processing
    - implement in python
 - generate meshes in python
    - different mesh formats

**âž¤ generate 3D-model from images**
